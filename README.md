# NPM Performance testing

Here is where I do some of my personal testing of NPM for my school assignment.

## Test tasks

- CPU-bound tasks -> This test is to test the performance of the CPU when running a task that is CPU-bound. This is done
  by running a task that is CPU-bound and measuring the time it takes to complete the task. 
  <br>Task used: `fibonacci(40)`
- I/O-bound tasks -> This test is to test the performance of the I/O when running a task that is I/O-bound. This is done
  by running a task that is I/O-bound and measuring the time it takes to complete the task.
  <br>Task used: `readFile('file.txt')`
